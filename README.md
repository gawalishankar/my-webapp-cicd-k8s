Project Overview
 This repository implements a scalable CI/CD pipeline for a full-stack web and mobile application
 consisting of:- Frontend: React- Backend: Django / Node.js- Mobile App: React Native- Authentication: Firebase- Deployment: DigitalOcean Kubernetes Cluster- CI/CD Tool: GitHub Actions- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana- Notifications: Slack
 
 Architecture Overview
 Environment Segregation:- main  Triggers production deployment- develop  Triggers staging deployment
 Containerization- Each component (frontend, backend, mobile-app) has its own Dockerfile.- Services managed using Kubernetes YAML manifests.
 
 CI/CD Workflow (GitHub Actions)
On PR Merge to main:- Lint & run unit tests- Build Docker images and push to DockerHub- Deploy to Kubernetes using kubectl- Send Slack notification for build status and deployment

 Kubernetes Structure
 k8s/
 backend.yaml
 frontend.yaml
 ingress.yaml
 Each service is exposed via Ingress and uses a LoadBalancer on Kubernetes.
 Secrets Management- GitHub Secrets:- DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD- SLACK_WEBHOOK- KUBE_CONFIG
 Monitoring & Alerts- Prometheus monitors: CPU, Memory, Uptime, Latency- Grafana dashboards- Slack Alerts for CPU > 70%, Pod crash, Deployment status
Rollbacks- GitHub Actions can redeploy previous image- Kubernetes Deployment with revision history and rollback
 Advanced Features- Blue-Green Deployment Strategy- Redis Caching Layer- Canary rollout with Progressive Rollout
 
 Testing
 cd frontend && npm test
 cd backend && pytest
 
 Quick Start
 docker build -t frontend ./frontend
 kubectl apply -f k8s/
